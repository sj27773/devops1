1. Clone the Repository

The first step is to clone the remote repository to your local machine. Use the following command:

bash

git clone <repository_url>

Replace <repository_url> with the URL of the repository you want to clone.
2. Check Out to a New Feature Branch

After cloning, switch to a new branch where you'll make your changes. This is typically done to avoid making changes directly on the main branch:

bash

git checkout -b <branch_name>

Replace <branch_name> with the name of your new branch, such as feature/my-feature.
3. Make Changes

Make the necessary changes in your code or project files.
4. Stage the Changes

After making changes, stage the files you want to commit:

bash

git add <file_name>  # To stage a specific file
git add .            # To stage all changed files

5. Commit the Changes

Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

bash

git commit -m "Add a description of your changes"

6. Pull the Latest Changes (Optional but Recommended)

Before pushing your changes, it's good practice to pull the latest changes from the remote repository to ensure you're not overriding any updates made by other developers:

bash

git pull origin <branch_name>

7. Push the Changes

Push your local branch to the remote repository:

bash

git push origin <branch_name>

8. Open a Pull Request (Optional)

If you're working in a team or on a feature branch, you'll typically open a Pull Request (PR) in your repository's GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket interface to merge your branch into main or develop.
